*** Testing ***

To test my site you should register a new account along with a horse. Then on your profile page
you should be able to view the status of your horse. You should also be able to enroll in an event and join the waitlist of another, you'll be able to manipulate the events you sign up for on your profile page. You will be required to pay with paypal to enroll in an event. You can use the paypal sandbox profile that I emailed to you to make that 'payment' (I don't want to publish those publicly). On the admin page you can create a new event and it will show up in the events list/calendar on the events page. The login for the admin account is just 'admin' and 'passwordforbcdixon'. The social media buttons at the bottom of the page don't link anywhere yet because those accounts haven't been created.
